# Build and Deploy a LSTM Model for Sentiment Analysis on SageMaker

In this project, we are interested in helping an entertainment company understand their customers' feedback about their movies. In particular, we have collected a bunch of reviews in text format about the company movies and would like to classify if those reviews are positive or negative. To this end, in this project, we present an end-to-end machine learning process from wrangling the data, building the classification model, to then deploying it as a web app using Amazon SageMaker. We introduce both a way to process the reviews in batch and the web app for interacting/testing our model. Although this project focuses specifically on movie reviews, the workflow in this project can be extended to understand customers' reaction to other kinds of products.
